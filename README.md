What is Inside DNA Sequence
Welcome to the "What is Inside DNA Sequence" project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the fascinating world of DNA sequence analysis using Python. The notebook leverages various bioinformatics libraries to provide insights into DNA sequences, including:

Biopython: For handling and analyzing biological data.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating informative and colorful visualizations.
NGLview: For visualizing molecular structures.
Features
DNA Sequence Parsing: Read and parse DNA sequences from FASTA files.
Sequence Visualization: Generate visual representations of nucleotide compositions.
Codon and Protein Analysis: Analyze codon usage and protein properties.
Color-Coded Sequence Representation: Visualize DNA sequences with color codes to represent different nucleotides and protein families.
